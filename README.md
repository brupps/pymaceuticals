Module 5 challenge

This challenge analyzed the data of the effectiveness of drug treatments on mice with tumors.

Using Pandas, matplotlib, and instruction from class taught by Othmane Benyoucef, as well as help from classmates Amanda Pigman and Cory Houston, and additional help from Stack Overflow and the AskBCS team as well as research, I was able to work through the assignment and write the code to get the desired results.
